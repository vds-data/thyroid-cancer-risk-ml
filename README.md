Thyroid Cancer Risk Analysis using Machine Learning: Classification, Clustering , Feature Correlations

This project develops a machine learning pipeline to assess thyroid cancer risk, identify critical predictive features, and support clinical decision-making through data-driven insights.


### 📌 Overview

This project aims to predict thyroid cancer risk using Machine Learning techniques applied to a real-world medical dataset.
It was developed as part of my MSc in Business Information Systems and demonstrates full-cycle data analytics, from data preprocessing and feature evaluation to model training, cross-validation, and GUI visualization.

The result is an interpretable, reproducible, and interactive analytical environment built entirely in Python, integrating both statistical rigor and visual clarity for clinical decision support.



### 🧠 Project Objectives

Develop explainable ML models for early detection of thyroid malignancy.

Identify key demographic, genetic, environmental, and biochemical predictors.

Ensure methodological reliability via robust cross-validation and balanced sampling.

Deliver a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for dynamic result exploration.


### 📊 Dataset

212,691 patient records

17 clinical & demographic features

Class imbalance present → addressed via subsampling

| Pre-risk Assessment                 | Thyroid_Cancer_Risk *(excluded from training — to avoid data leakage)* |
| **Target Variable**                 | **Diagnosis** (Benign vs Malignant)                                    |


📌 Total Features Used in Modeling: 16 predictors + 1 target = 17 attributes


### 🛠️ ML Workflow & Methodology
1️⃣ Data Validation & Preprocessing

Ensured medical-grade data quality
(feature relevance screening, no missing/duplicate records, outlier validation on endocrine markers)

Encoded categorical values & standardized continuous features for supervised learning algorithms
<br>

2️⃣ 🔍 Correlation Analysis for Continuous Clinical Features

(TSH_Level, T3_Level, T4_Level, Nodule_Size, Age)

Pearson Correlation Matrix → Heatmap Visualization

Result: Low correlation strength (|r| < 0.7)

➡️ Minimal multicollinearity → all predictors retained

<br>



3️⃣ 🧬 Unsupervised Learning — K-Means Clustering

Explored natural grouping without using Diagnosis & 

Weak clustering structure

➡️ Confirms need for supervised ML for diagnostic prediction




| Step | Technique | Why You Used It | Field Impact |
|------|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| Normalization | StandardScaler (Mean=0, Std=1) | Ensures equal contribution of differently scaled features; improves comparisons across LR & RF | Better gradient behavior & fairer clinical indicator influence |
| Train/Test Split | 75% Train / 25% Test | Aligns with 4-Fold CV distribution (~25% per fold); maintains unseen test set | Fair generalization estimate for real-world deployment |
| Cross-Validation | Stratified 4-Fold CV — Repeated 100x | Preserves Diagnosis ratio in all folds; reduces variance from class imbalance | Clinically stable & reproducible model evaluation |
| Class Imbalance Solution | Repeated balanced subsampling (50 malignant / 50 benign each repetition) | Prevents model bias toward majority benign cases | Equitable cancer-risk assessment; higher trust in malignant predictions |


📌 Models evaluated 100 times with a 75% train - 25% test → Final scores = Median Accuracy + Median AUC




4️⃣ Feature Importance

Algorithms used:

Logistic Regression → interpretable risk contribution

Random Forest → nonlinear feature interactions

SHAP values validated LR’s findings.

Top 3 Stable Prognostic Factors:
1️⃣ Family_History
2️⃣ Iodine_Deficiency
3️⃣ Radiation_Exposure

Consistent with biological expectations ✔



✔ 5️⃣ Triad-Based Performance Evaluation

Instead of evaluating single attributes alone ⟶
Created all possible combinations of 3-feature models ("Triads")

Why?
🧠 Cancer risk is multifactorial → interactions matter more

Evaluated using:

Sub-sampling balanced training (100 iterations)

Stratified 4-Fold Cross-Validation

Median Accuracy & AUC

Results Summary
| Model               | Best Median Accuracy | Best Median AUC | Stability |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Logistic Regression | ~0.59                | ~0.61           | Higher    |
